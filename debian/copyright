 parser.c : an XML 1.0 parser, namespaces and validity support are mostly
 implemented on top of the SAX interfaces
 .
 References:
 The XML specification:
 http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml
 Original 1.0 version:
 http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-xml-19980210
 XML second edition working draft
 http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-xml-2e-20000814
 .
 Okay this is a big file, the parser core is around 7000 lines, then it
 is followed by the progressive parser top routines, then the various
 high level APIs to call the parser and a few miscellaneous functions.
 A number of helper functions and deprecated ones have been moved to
 parserInternals.c to reduce this file size.
 As much as possible the functions are associated with their relative
 production in the XML specification. A few productions defining the
 different ranges of character are actually implanted either in
 parserInternals.h or parserInternals.c
 The DOM tree build is realized from the default SAX callbacks in
 the module SAX.c.
 The routines doing the validation checks are in valid.c and called either
 from the SAX callbacks or as standalone functions using a preparsed
 document.

 - compilation flags to check for specific syntaxes
 using flags of xmlPatterncompile()
 - making clear how pattern starting with / or . need to be handled,
 currently push(NULL, NULL) means a reset of the streaming context
 and indicating we are on / (the document node), probably need
 something similar for .
 - get rid of the "compile" starting with lowercase
 - DONE (2006-05-16): get rid of the Strdup/Strndup in case of dictionary

 There are two approaches for detecting a write error on a stream opened
 for writing:
 .
 (a) Test the return value of every fwrite() or fprintf() call, and react
 immediately.
 (b) Just before fclose(), test the error indicator in the stream and
 the return value of the final fclose() call.
 .
 The benefit of (a) is that non file related errors (such that ENOMEM during
 fprintf) and temporary error conditions can be diagnosed accurately.
 .
 A theoretical benefit of (a) is also that, on POSIX systems, in the case of
 an ENOSPC error, errno is set and can be used by error() to provide a more
 accurate error message. But in practice, this benefit is not big because
 users can easily figure out by themselves why a file cannot be written to,
 and furthermore the function fwriteerror() can provide errno as well.
 .
 The big drawback of (a) is extensive error checking code: Every function
 which does stream output must return an error indicator.
 .
 This file provides support for (b).

 All the apparent functions defined here are macros. The idea
 is that you would use these pre-tested macros to solve a
 very specific set of problems, and they would run fast.
 Caution: no side-effects in arguments please!! They may be
 evaluated MANY times!!
 .
 These macros operate a stack of objects.  Each object starts life
 small, and may grow to maturity.  (Consider building a word syllable
 by syllable.)  An object can move while it is growing.  Once it has
 been "finished" it never changes address again.  So the "top of the
 stack" is typically an immature growing object, while the rest of the
 stack is of mature, fixed size and fixed address objects.
 .
 These routines grab large chunks of memory, using a function you

 As a special exception, you may create a larger work that contains
 part or all of the Bison parser skeleton and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, so long as that work isn't itself a
 parser generator using the skeleton or a modified version thereof
 as a parser skeleton.  Alternatively, if you modify or redistribute
 the parser skeleton itself, you may (at your option) remove this
 special exception, which will cause the skeleton and the resulting
 Bison output files to be licensed under the GNU General Public
 License without this special exception.
 .
 This special exception was added by the Free Software Foundation in
 version 2.2 of Bison.

 IEEE 754 standardized three items:
 - The formats of single-float and double-float - nowadays commonly
 available as 'float' and 'double' in C and C++.
 No autoconf test needed.
 - The overflow and division by zero behaviour: The result are values
 '±Inf' and 'NaN', rather than exceptions as it was before.
 This file provides an autoconf macro for ensuring this behaviour of
 floating-point operations.
 - A set of conditions (overflow, underflow, inexact, etc.) which can
 be configured to trigger an exception.
 This cannot be done in a portable way: it depends on the compiler,
 libc, kernel, and CPU.  No autoconf macro is provided for this.
 .
 Ensure non-trapping behaviour of floating-point overflow and
 floating-point division by zero.
 (For integer overflow, see gcc's -ftrapv option; for integer division by
 zero, see the autoconf macro in intdiv0.m4.)

 The basic idea is to consider two vectors as similar if, when
 transforming the first vector into the second vector through a
 sequence of edits (inserts and deletes of one element each),
 this sequence is short - or equivalently, if the ordered list
 of elements that are untouched by these edits is long.  For a
 good introduction to the subject, read about the "Levenshtein
 distance" in Wikipedia.
 .
 The basic algorithm is described in:
 "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and its Variations", Eugene W. Myers,
 Algorithmica Vol. 1, 1986, pp. 251-266,
 <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01840446>.
 See especially section 4.2, which describes the variation used below.
 .
 The basic algorithm was independently discovered as described in:
 "Algorithms for Approximate String Matching", Esko Ukkonen,
 Information and Control Vol. 64, 1985, pp. 100-118,
 <https://doi.org/10.1016/S0019-9958(85)80046-2>.

 This file defines minimal facilities for object-oriented programming
 style in ANSI C.
 .
 The facilities allow to define classes with single inheritance and
 "virtual" methods.
 .
 Strict type checking is provided in combination with a C++ compiler:
 The code compiles in ANSI C with less strict type checking; when
 compiled with a C++ compiler, strict type checking is done.
 .
 In contrast to [OOC] and [OOPC], this implementation concentrates on the
 bare essentials of an object-oriented programming style.  It does not
 provide features that are "sometimes useful", but not essential.
 .
 Features:
 - Combination of fields and methods into a single object.      YES
 - Description of objects of same shape and same behaviour
 by a class.                                                  YES
 - Single inheritance.                                          YES
 - Multiple inheritance.                                        NO
 - Operator overloading (compile-time polymorphism).            NO
 - Virtual methods (run-time polymorphism).                     YES
 - Information hiding: private/protected/public.         private fields
 - Static fields and methods.                                   NO
 - Constructors, destructors.                                   NO
 - 'new', 'delete'.                                             NO
 - Exception handling.                                          NO
 - Garbage collection.                                          NO
 - Templates / Generic classes with parameters.                 NO
 - Namespaces.                                                  NO
 - Hidden 'this' pointer in methods.                            NO
 - Declaring or implementing several classes in the same file.  NO
 .
 Rationale for NO:
 - Multiple inheritance is not supported because programming languages
 like Java and C# prove that they are not necessary. Modern design
 patterns use delegation more often than composition; this reduces
 the pressure to use multiple inheritance.
 Multiple inheritance of "interfaces" (classes without fields) might
 be considered, though.
 - Operator overloading is not essential: The programmer can rename
 methods so that they carry unambiguous method names. This also makes
 the code more readable.
 - Virtual methods are supported. Non-virtual methods are not: they
 constitute an assumption about the possible subclasses which is more
 often wrong than right. In other words, non-virtual methods are a
 premature optimization - "the root of all evil", according to
 Donald E. Knuth.
 - Information hiding: 'protected' is not supported because it is always
 inappropriate: it prohibits the use of the delegation design pattern.
 'private' is implemented on fields. There are no 'public' fields,
 since the use of getters/setters allows for overriding in subclasses
 and is more maintainable (ability to set breakpoints). On the other
 hand, all methods are 'public'. 'private` methods are not supported
 because methods with static linkage can be used instead.
 - Static fields and methods are not supported because normal variables
 and functions with static or extern linkage can be used instead.
 - Constructors and destructors are not supported.  The programmer can

License:   __HEADER___
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
 [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
 freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
 .
 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations
 below.
 .
 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
 not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
 these things.
 .
 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
 rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
 .
 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
 you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
 code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
 it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
 .
 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
 .
 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
 there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
 author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
 introduced by others.
 ^L
 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
 any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
 restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
 .
 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
 ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
 libraries into non-free programs.
 .
 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
 combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
 the library.
 .
 We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
 does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
 Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
 of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
 libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
 special circumstances.
 .
 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
 becomes
 a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
 allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
 .
 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
 free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
 system.
 .
 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
 users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
 that program using a modified version of the Library.
 .
 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
 "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
 be combined with the library in order to run.
 ^L
 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
 .
 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
 this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
 Each licensee is addressed as "you".
 .
 A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
 .
 The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
 which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
 Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
 straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
 included without limitation in the term "modification".)
 .
 "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
 compilation
 and installation of the library.
 .
 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
 covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
 writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
 and what the program that uses the Library does.
 .
 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
 Library.
 .
 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
 fee.
 .
 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
 a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
 .
 b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
 .
 c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
 .
 d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
 in the event an application does not supply such function or
 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
 its purpose remains meaningful.
 .
 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
 application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
 application-supplied function or table used by this function must
 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
 root function must still compute square roots.)
 .
 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
 sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
 it.
 .
 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
 collective works based on the Library.
 .
 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
 the scope of this License.
 .
 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
 instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
 that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
 these notices.
 ^L
 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
 .
 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
 the Library into a program that is not a library.
 .
 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
 medium customarily used for software interchange.
 .
 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
 compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
 .
 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
 linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
 therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
 .
 However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
 contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
 library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
 .
 When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
 .
 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
 work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
 Library will still fall under Section 6.)
 .
 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
 ^L
 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
 link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
 engineering for debugging such modifications.
 .
 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
 this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
 directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
 of these things:
 .
 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
 uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
 executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
 to use the modified definitions.)
 .
 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
 Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
 .
 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
 least three years, to give the same user the materials
 specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
 than the cost of performing this distribution.
 .
 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
 specified materials from the same place.
 .
 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
 .
 For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
 Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
 reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
 the executable.
 .
 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
 accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
 distribute.
 ^L
 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
 permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
 .
 a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
 facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
 Sections above.
 .
 b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
 .
 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
 the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
 rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
 .
 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
 signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
 distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
 the Library or works based on it.
 .
 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
 subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
 this License.
 ^L
 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
 may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
 .
 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
 apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
 circumstances.
 .
 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
 integrity of the free software distribution system which is
 implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
 impose that choice.
 .
 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
 be a consequence of the rest of this License.
 .
 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License
 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
 countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
 countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
 the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
 .
 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
 .
 Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
 "any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
 the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
 the Free Software Foundation.
 ^L
 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
 write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
 and reuse of software generally.
 .
 NO WARRANTY
 .
 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
 DAMAGES.
 .
 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 ^L
 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
 .
 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
 everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
 redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms
 of the ordinary General Public License).
 .
 To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
 It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
 effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should
 have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full
 notice is found.
 .
 <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it
 does.>
 Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
 This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
 modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
 version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
 .
 This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
 Lesser General Public License for more details.
 .
 You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
 License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
 Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston,
 MA 02110-1301, USA
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
 mail.
 .
 You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
 your
 school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
 necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
 .
 Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
 library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James
 Random Hacker.

 This script checks whether the files in the GNU gettext package
 have the required copyright headers resp. license notices.
 .
 Copyright notices have two purposes:
 .
 1. They tell the people who obtain the package (as a git checkout,
 source tarball, or binary package) what they are allowed to do
 with it.
 .
 2. They provide the legal basis for suing people who infringe on
 the copyright of the package (or part of it).  In particular,
 they should prove that the infringer knew what they were doing
 when they took a source file (or part of it) and used it in
 a way that is not compliant with the license.
 .
 For the purpose 1, a file COPYING at the top-level of the package
 and a reference to it in the main README are all that's needed.
 .
 For the purpose 2, we put copyright notices in each file that we
 don't want to be abused of. See also the section "Copyright Notices"
 in the 'Information for maintainers of GNU software',
 .

 Whether to use 'volatile' on some variables that communicate information
 between threads.  If set to 0, a semaphore or a lock is used to protect
 these variables.  If set to 1, 'volatile' is used; this is theoretically
 equivalent but can lead to much slower execution (e.g. 30x slower total
 run time on a 40-core machine), because 'volatile' does not imply any
 synchronization/communication between different CPUs.

 There are four ways to build shared libraries on Cygwin:
 .
 - Export only functions, no variables.
 This has the drawback of severely affecting the programming style in use.
 It does not let the programmer use full ANSI C.  It lets one platform
 dictate the code style on all platforms.  This is unacceptable.
 .
 - Use the GNU ld --enable-auto-import option.  It is the default on Cygwin
 since July 2005. But it has three fatal drawbacks:
 - It produces executables and shared libraries with relocations in the
 .text segment, defeating the principles of virtual memory.
 - For some constructs such as
 extern int var;

 Commentary:
 .
 This package provides the tools meant to help editing PO files,
 as documented in the GNU gettext user's manual.  See this manual
 for user documentation, which is not repeated here.
 .
 To install, merely put this file somewhere GNU Emacs will find it,
 then add the following lines to your .emacs file:
 .
 (autoload 'po-mode "po-mode"
 "Major mode for translators to edit PO files" t)
 (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.po\\'\\|\\.po\\." . po-mode)
 auto-mode-alist))
 .
 To use the right coding system automatically under Emacs 20 or newer,
 also add:
 .
 (autoload 'po-find-file-coding-system "po-compat")
 (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.po\\'\\|\\.po\\."
 'po-find-file-coding-system)
 .
 You may also adjust some variables, below, by defining them in your
 '.emacs' file, either directly or through command 'M-x customize'.
 .

 Plural form editing:
 - When in edit mode, currently it highlights (in green) the msgid;

 This script is derived from GIT-VERSION-GEN from GIT: https://git-scm.com/.
 It may be run two ways:
 - from a git repository in which the "git describe" command below
 produces useful output (thus requiring at least one signed tag)
 - from a non-git-repo directory containing a .tarball-version file, which
 presumes this script is invoked like "./git-version-gen .tarball-version".
 .
 In order to use intra-version strings in your project, you will need two
 separate generated version string files:
 .
 .tarball-version - present only in a distribution tarball, and not in
 a checked-out repository.  Created with contents that were learned at
 the last time autoconf was run, and used by git-version-gen.  Must not
 be present in either $(srcdir) or $(builddir) for git-version-gen to
 give accurate answers during normal development with a checked out tree,
 but must be present in a tarball when there is no version control system.
 Therefore, it cannot be used in any dependencies.  GNUmakefile has
 hooks to force a reconfigure at distribution time to get the value
 correct, without penalizing normal development with extra reconfigures.
 .
 .version - present in a checked-out repository and in a distribution
 tarball.  Usable in dependencies, particularly for files that don't
 want to depend on config.h but do want to track version changes.
 Delete this file prior to any autoconf run where you want to rebuild
 files to pick up a version string change; and leave it stale to
 minimize rebuild time after unrelated changes to configure sources.
 .
 As with any generated file in a VC'd directory, you should add
 /.version to .gitignore, so that you don't accidentally commit it.
 .tarball-version is never generated in a VC'd directory, so needn't
 be listed there.
 .
 Use the following line in your configure.ac, so that $(VERSION) will
 automatically be up-to-date each time configure is run (and note that
 since configure.ac no longer includes a version string, Makefile rules
 should not depend on configure.ac for version updates).

 Using the GNU gettext approach, compiled message catalogs are assemblies
 containing just one class, a subclass of GettextResourceSet. They are thus
 interoperable with standard ResourceManager based code.
 .
 The main differences between the common .NET resources approach and the
 GNU gettext approach are:
 - In the .NET resource approach, the keys are abstract textual shortcuts.
 In the GNU gettext approach, the keys are the English/ASCII version
 of the messages.
 - In the .NET resource approach, the translation files are called
 "Resource.locale.resx" and are UTF-8 encoded XML files. In the GNU gettext
 approach, the translation files are called "Resource.locale.po" and are
 in the encoding the translator has chosen. There are at least three GUI
 translating tools (Emacs PO mode, KDE KBabel, GNOME gtranslator).
 - In the .NET resource approach, the function ResourceManager.GetString
 returns an empty string or throws an InvalidOperationException when no
 translation is found. In the GNU gettext approach, the GetString function
 returns the (English) message key in that case.
 - In the .NET resource approach, there is no support for plural handling.
 In the GNU gettext approach, we have the GetPluralString function.
 - In the .NET resource approach, there is no support for context specific
 translations.
 In the GNU gettext approach, we have the GetParticularString function.
 .
 To compile GNU gettext message catalogs into C# assemblies, the msgfmt
 program can be used.

 Tree search for red/black trees.
 The algorithm for adding nodes is taken from one of the many "Algorithms"
 books by Robert Sedgewick, although the implementation differs.
 The algorithm for deleting nodes can probably be found in a book named
 "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen/Leiserson/Rivest.  At least that's
 the book that my professor took most algorithms from during the "Data
 Structures" course...
 .
 Totally public domain.
 .
 Red/black trees are binary trees in which the edges are colored either red
 or black.  They have the following properties:
 1. The number of black edges on every path from the root to a leaf is
 constant.
 2. No two red edges are adjacent.
 Therefore there is an upper bound on the length of every path, it's
 O(log n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.  No path can be longer
 than 1+2*P where P is the length of the shortest path in the tree.
 Useful for the implementation:
 3. If one of the children of a node is NULL, then the other one is red
 (if it exists).
 .
 In the implementation, not the edges are colored, but the nodes.  The color
 interpreted as the color of the edge leading to this node.  The color is
 meaningless for the root node, but we color the root node black for
 convenience.  All added nodes are red initially.
 .
 Adding to a red/black tree is rather easy.  The right place is searched
 with a usual binary tree search.  Additionally, whenever a node N is
 reached that has two red successors, the successors are colored black and
 the node itself colored red.  This moves red edges up the tree where they
 pose less of a problem once we get to really insert the new node.  Changing
 N's color to red may violate rule 2, however, so rotations may become
 necessary to restore the invariants.  Adding a new red leaf may violate
 the same rule, so afterwards an additional check is run and the tree
 possibly rotated.
 .
 Deleting is hairy.  There are mainly two nodes involved: the node to be
 deleted (n1), and another node that is to be unchained from the tree (n2).
 If n1 has a successor (the node with a smallest key that is larger than
 n1), then the successor becomes n2 and its contents are copied into n1,
 otherwise n1 becomes n2.
 Unchaining a node may violate rule 1: if n2 is black, one subtree is
 missing one black edge afterwards.  The algorithm must try to move this
 error upwards towards the root, so that the subtree that does not have
 enough black edges becomes the whole tree.  Once that happens, the error
 has disappeared.  It may not be necessary to go all the way up, since it
 is possible that rotations and recoloring can fix the error before that.
 .
 Although the deletion algorithm must walk upwards through the tree, we
 do not store parent pointers in the nodes.  Instead, delete allocates a
 small array of parent pointers and fills it while descending the tree.
 Since we know that the length of a path is O(log n), where n is the number
 of nodes, this is likely to use less memory.
 .
 Tree rotations look like this:
 A                C
 / \              / \
 B   C            A   G
 / \ / \  -->     / \
 D E F G         B   F
 / \
 D   E
 .
 In this case, A has been rotated left.  This preserves the ordering of the
 binary tree.

 When compiling for SPARC in 32-bit mode, make sure that instructions for
 SPARC v8+ are accepted.  This is necessary for multiprocessing (for
 instructions like 'membar' or 'cas').  All SPARC CPUs made since 1993
 support this instruction set.  But GCC in its default configuration, in
 32-bit mode (64-bit mode assumes SPARC v9 or newer), still defaults to
 SPARC v7 instruction set: "By default (unless configured otherwise), GCC
 generates code for the V7 variant of the SPARC architecture."  See
 <https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.6.4/gcc/SPARC-Options.html>

 1 Introduction
 **************
 .
 Text is easier to read when it is accompanied with styling
 information, such as color, font attributes (weight, posture), or
 underlining, and this styling is customized appropriately for the output
 device.
 .
 GNU libtextstyle provides an easy way to add styling to programs that
 produce output to a console or terminal emulator window.  It does this
 in a way that allows the end user to customize the styling using the
 industry standard, namely Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

 It is also interesting for translators, because GNU gettext provides
 the 'msgmerge' program, which prepares a message catalog before a
 translation update.
 .
 Users of GNU packages should also install GNU gettext because some
 other GNU packages will use the gettext program included in this
 package to internationalize the messages given by shell scripts.
 .
 The homepage of this package is at
 .
 https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
 .
 The primary FTP site for its distribution is
 .
 https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/
 .
 Report bugs
 - in the bug tracker at <https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/gettext>
 - or by email to <bug-gettext@gnu.org>.
 .
 The configure script provides a non-standard option.  It is also
 available in other packages that use the functionality of GNU gettext.
 Use
 .
 --disable-nls
 .
 if you absolutely don't want to have messages handling code.  You will
 always get the original messages (mostly English).  You could consider
 using NLS support even when you do not need other tongues.  If you do
 not install any messages catalogs or do not specify to use another but
 the C locale you will not get translations.
 .
 The set of languages for which catalogs should be installed can also be
 specified while configuring.  Of course they must be available but the
 intersection of these two sets are computed automatically.  You could
 once and for all define in your profile/cshrc the variable LINGUAS:

 The translations covered by this disclaimer include, without
 limitation, translations of textual messages, glossaries, command or
 option names, help files, user interface text, and the like, contained

 1 Introduction
 **************
 .
 This package makes the C formatted output routines ('fprintf' et al.)
 usable in C++ programs, for use with the '<string>' strings and the
 '<iostream>' streams.
 .
 It allows to write code like
 .
 cerr << autosprintf ("syntax error in %s:%d: %s", filename, line, errstring);
 .
 instead of
 .
 cerr << "syntax error in " << filename << ":" << line << ": " << errstring;
 .
 The benefits of the autosprintf syntax are:
 .
 * It reuses the standard POSIX printf facility.  Easy migration from
 C to C++.
 .
 * English sentences are kept together.
 .
 * It makes internationalization possible.  Internationalization
 requires format strings, because in some cases the translator needs
 to change the order of a sentence, and more generally it is easier
 for the translator to work with a single string for a sentence than
 with multiple string pieces.
 .
 * It reduces the risk of programming errors due to forgotten state in
 the output stream (e.g. 'cout << hex;' not followed by 'cout <<
 dec;').

 2 The 'autosprintf' class
 *************************
 .
 An instance of class 'autosprintf' just contains a string with the
 formatted output result.  Such an instance is usually allocated as an
 automatic storage variable, i.e. on the stack, not with 'new' on the
 heap.
 .
 The constructor 'autosprintf (const char *format, ...)' takes a
 format string and additional arguments, like the C function 'printf'.
 .
 Conversions to 'char *' and 'std::string' are defined that return the
 encapsulated string.  The conversion to 'char *' returns a freshly
 allocated copy of the encapsulated string; it needs to be freed using
 'delete[]'.  The conversion to 'std::string' returns a copy of the
 encapsulated string, with automatic memory management.
 .
 The destructor '~autosprintf ()' destroys the encapsulated string.
 .
 An 'operator <<' is provided that outputs the encapsulated string to
 the given 'ostream'.

 3 Using 'autosprintf' in own programs
 *************************************
 .
 To use the 'autosprintf' class in your programs, you need to add
 .
 #include "autosprintf.h"
 using gnu::autosprintf;
 .
 to your source code.  The include file defines the class 'autosprintf',
 in a namespace called 'gnu'.  The 'using' statement makes it possible to
 use the class without the (otherwise natural) 'gnu::' prefix.
 .
 When linking your program, you need to link with 'libasprintf',
 because that's where the class is defined.  In projects using GNU

 Some systems, reportedly OpenBSD and Mac OS X, refuse to create
 libraries without any object files.  You might get an error like:
 .

 > ar: no archive members specified
 .
 Compiling this file, and adding its object file to the library, will
 prevent the library from being empty.

 Some systems, such as Solaris with cc 5.0, refuse to work with libraries
 that don't export any symbol.  You might get an error like:

                     GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
 .
  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
                             Preamble
 .
   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.
 .
   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
 GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
 your programs, too.
 .
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
 certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
 .
   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
 gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
 know their rights.
 .
   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
 .
   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
 that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
 authors of previous versions.
 .
   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
 .
   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
 .
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
   0. Definitions.
 .
   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 .
   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.
 .
   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 .
   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
 .
   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.
 .
   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 .
   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 .
   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 .
   1. Source Code.
 .
   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 form of a work.
 .
   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.
 .
   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 .
   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.
 .
   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 Source.
 .
   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
 same work.
 .
   2. Basic Permissions.
 .
   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 .
   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 .
   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
 makes it unnecessary.
 .
   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 .
   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.
 .
   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
 technological measures.
 .
   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 .
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 .
   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 .
   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
     it, and giving a relevant date.
 .
     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
     released under this License and any conditions added under section
     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
     "keep intact all notices".
 .
     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
 .
     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
     work need not make them do so.
 .
   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
 parts of the aggregate.
 .
   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 .
   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
 in one of these ways:
 .
     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
     customarily used for software interchange.
 .
     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 .
     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
     with subsection 6b.
 .
     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 .
     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
     charge under subsection 6d.
 .
   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
 included in conveying the object code work.
 .
   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
 tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
 product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
 the only significant mode of use of the product.
 .
   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
 modification has been made.
 .
   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
 if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
 modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
 been installed in ROM).
 .
   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
 for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
 protocols for communication across the network.
 .
   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
 source code form), and must require no special password or key for
 unpacking, reading or copying.
 .
   7. Additional Terms.
 .
   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
 this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 .
   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
 for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 .
     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 .
     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
 .
     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
 .
     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
     authors of the material; or
 .
     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
 .
     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
     those licensors and authors.
 .
   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
 restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
 governed by this License along with a term that is a further
 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
 not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 .
   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
 where to find the applicable terms.
 .
   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
 the above requirements apply either way.
 .
   8. Termination.
 .
   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
 paragraph of section 11).
 .
   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
 prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 .
   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 your receipt of the notice.
 .
   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
 material under section 10.
 .
   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 .
   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
 .
   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 .
   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
 .
   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 .
   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 .
   11. Patents.
 .
   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
 .
   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
 purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
 this License.
 .
   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
 propagate the contents of its contributor version.
 .
   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
 sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
 patent against the party.
 .
   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
 patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
 license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
 actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
 country that you have reason to believe are valid.
 .
   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
 work and works based on it.
 .
   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
 work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
 for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
 .
   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
 otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
 .
   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
 .
   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
 not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 .
   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
 License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
 but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
 section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
 combination as such.
 .
   14. Revised Versions of this License.
 .
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
 GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
 by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
 versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
 to choose that version for the Program.
 .
   Later license versions may give you additional or different
 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
 later version.
 .
   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 .
   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
 IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   16. Limitation of Liability.
 .
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
 .
   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
 above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
 reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
 an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
 Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
 copy of the Program in return for a fee.
 .
                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
 .
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
 .
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
   If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
 notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
 .
     <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
     This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
 .
 The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
 parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
 might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
 .
   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
 For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
   The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
 into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
 may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
 the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
 Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
 <https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.
